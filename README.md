# cats-vs-dogs-classifier
This project demonstrates how to build a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images of cats and dogs using TensorFlow and Keras. The model is trained on a labeled dataset of cat and dog images and aims to distinguish between the two classes based on image features.
